# About Me

My statistical interests include Bayesian hierarchical modeling, inference for dynamical systems, experimental design, and spatio-temporal statistics. I am especially interested in applications of statistics that build upon our knowledge of biological and physical systems. I have worked on a diverse set of problems in government and industry settings. These have included topics such as:
 
 - Characterizing the degree to which high-flow nasal cannula devices produce and disperse aerosols over time.
 - Exploring how fish growth and population dynamics are influenced by spatially varying factors governing nutrient bioavailabilty.
 - Spatio-temporal dependence modeling of extreme wind speeds, temperatures, and precipitation.

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Pennsylvania State University, where I was advised by [Benjamin Shaby](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~bshaby/), and focused on spatio-temporal dependence modeling. I am now currently employed at [Verisk](https://www.verisk.com) where I am developing statistical models of atmospheric perils such as extratropical cyclones and severe convective storms.
